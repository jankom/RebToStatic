What is RebToStatic
===================

Compiler for a subset of rebol to more static (FP-ish) languages, concretely 
this means JavaScript for now.

Example of current state:
=========================

This REBOL:
---
sum: func [ a1 b1 ] [ ret: add a1 join "something" b1 ]
a: mod 100 200
c: "bobo"
blk: func [ a ] [ add a 100 ]
---

compiles to:
---
var sum =  function(a1,b1){var ret = add(a1,join("something",b1));}; 
var a = mod(100,200);var c = "bobo";var blk =  function(a){add(a,100)};
---

And This:
---
person: context [
	name: "Jimy"
	sayHi: func [ a ] [ join "hi, " a ]
	tags: [ "jojo" 123 ]
	subobj: context [
		a: 10
		b: [ "jo" "no" [ 1 2 3 ] ]
	]
]
---

to this:
---
var person = {name:"Jimy",sayHi: function(a){join("hi, ",a)},tags:["jojo",123,],
subobj:{a:10,b:["jo","no",[1,2,3,],],},};
---

The code is very early in development. As you can see the generated JavaScript 
is not perfect. there are no returns for now and "," separators shouldn't be there
after the last element of array or object.
